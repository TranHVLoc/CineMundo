## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to meet a few times during the week to talk about our wireframes and entity relationship diagram.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had some issues sharing access to Balsamiq wireframes at first, but we gained access for both group memebers.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We're thinking of possibly adding log in functionality down the line, so we might need support with that.
