## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to finish the backend portion of the project and got past an issue connecting with our database.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Our configuration for connecting to our railway database was wrong when we created the initial backend files, and we didn't realize this until much later.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We moved most of the frontend tasks to the next week since we spent more time on the backend than expected. Frontend should be the priority next week.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We don't have any "at risk" stories at this time. We'll have to see next week if we run into any issues. If so, we can remove any non-essential features.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Right now I think we are good to go. We got past the issue that was holding up our progress.
