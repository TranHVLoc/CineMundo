## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Everything went well. We had a short but productive meeting early in the week, and were able to come up with the basic concept behind our app.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We didn't have any major challenges, since we decided on on our idea pretty quickly and discussed all the relevant features during our initial group meeting. The hardest part of the process was picking a name for the app.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Right now everything is going smoothly. However, as we implement the more complex features, we'll probably have additional technical questions for our TF and for the help Slack channel.
