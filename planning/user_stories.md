## Outline User Roles

**Owner**: a user who love to keep her favourite list of movies at a website for easier access and update everytime

## Draft User Stories

1. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to be able to create a profile for a new movie, so that I can add movie details such as name, director, actors, etc. through user input fields.

2. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to be able to edit movie data fields for each movie, so that I can update the information as needed.

3. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to be able to delete a movie from the movie dashboard, so that I can remove movies that I no longer want to keep track of.

4. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to be able to create a watchlist to save my plan for the weekend, so that I can keep track of the movies that I want to watch.

5. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to be able to remove a movie from a watchlist, so that I can remove movies that I no longer want to keep track of.

6. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to personalize my list so that the only person to know the list is me, by authorization, because it's private.

7. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to display my movies in either cards form or timeline based on the time that movie was published.

8. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to sort the film *chrononically/lexicographically* or search the film based on their title using search bar or sort buttons

9. 👉🏾 As a user, I want to see the detailed pieces of information of that movie as a popup by clicking on its card and read its description, actors, director, and even watch its trailer straight on that.

10. 👉🏾 As a user, I want each film will have their corresponding tags so that in its detailed popup, if I click on any tag, the list will be filtered based on that tag. By clicking the tag again, the dashboard returns to its full list.
